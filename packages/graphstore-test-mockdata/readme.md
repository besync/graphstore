# GRAPHSTORE-DEV In Memory Mock Firebase Store

This repository contains an in memory model of a Firebase realtime database.   It is used for mocking test data for the @besync/graphstore repository, but can be used as a model for your own mocking (or offline) purposes.   Just drop in a different schema (or generate one from your firebase using @besync/graphstore-dev)!

## Example usage
See the __tests__ folder of @besync/graphstore for example usage.
